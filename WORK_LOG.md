| Oct 16 |   1-1:45   |                                    I thought about how to solve the problem today. I remember that in CS1 the solution was to do a sort of linear search that would iterate though the entire length. Obviously, we can't do that now because the string is just too large to do something like that. I'm trying to think of a way to cut down on some parts of the linear search to make it more efficient, but I haven't been able to think of anything yet. |

Just trying to set a baseline for what I could do. After I finish that I will see what parts I could possible shorten. |

I used a for loop and then a while loop inside just to make sure that I check all the patterns. I don't exactly know where I could possibly cut runtime but at least I finished something. I will try later to see if there is anything. |

One method I thought of was skipping ahead when I have processed a STR sequence. But don't think that would work because then I have to set back the i variable a lot and everything would just be screwed up. I don't really know what to do so I'm kinda just waiting for the hint. |
| Oct 23 |    2-3     |                                                                                                                               I spent the class working on implementing the hash function. I looked at the slides and then kind of copied it to make various functions. I initially had a problem using a inner for loop so I changed it to a while loop which seemed to help. So far I have some right but some of them are wrong so I need to figure it out. |
| Oct 27 |   1:30-2   | I tried using a while loop on the outside to iterate but it didn't end up working as I was trying to find a way to get the index back to what it was before there was a match but for some reason everything went out of bounds. I switched back to a for loop after that and added a couple of temporary variables to keep track of index and sequence hashes and then it work for most of the tests but for some it returns 0 so I need to figure that out.  |
